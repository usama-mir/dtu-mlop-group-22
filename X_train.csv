0," Died in 2014 or not? I think it's better to settle the matter here instead of going back and forth. So, the IP user claims that the whole thing is a hoax; that she died in Europe years ago and that there's no Hawaii obit. First of all, is the ""Forevermissed"" a user submitted website? 24.206.199.151: Do you know her family personally or do you know somebody who knows the family? We'd like to get a more elaborate explainantion behind the claim that she's been dead years ago. I see that her supposed obituary is pretty detailed. Are the rest of the biographical information accurate, though? And the picture? "

2,"In history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view, in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view, since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian. Historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity, while theology makes no such claims. It is true that there are millions who believe that JEDP was birthed in hell (or would believe it if they knew what JEDP means so in principle their view is notable, but as Enns said, it is a fringe view in the academe, even among scholars who actually disagree with JEDP. The sources used to build Wikipedia are academic sources, therefore JEDP and its 20 21st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia, while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to WP:UNDUE. This does not mean that Wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong (Wikipedia has no theology of its own but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view. Of course, this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties, since as Ehrman said in one of his bestsellers, US mainline Protestant and Catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes. So, in a sense, scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions. Only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism. They are free to do this, but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians."

22," Can there be a more concise listing? The listing of ""other inventions"" is profoundly vague. Why group 4 different categories together? Why even mention things that the chinese received purely from outside sources? There should be a much more complete, well managed list of chinese developments, which I've yet to find along with how these were transmitted globally, and whether or not places like Europe got them purely from the Chinese. This really needs the attention of people with some remote expertise, which I guess is somewhat there when Needham's work, which is profoundly rare in private collections was cited not like the arrogant bigoted ass who was crying about chinese nationalism, yet then went onto say that they only invented noodles. And besides, why are things like the cannon and porcelain listed under ""other inventions Who developed these independently?"

38,"The discussion of when there first were outdoor trees with electric lights is very strange. 1956? are you kidding? and some obscure town in NC? I don't think this makes much sense, especially since the sentences immediately preceding these establish that other cities had electrically lighted, outdoor Christmas trees in the early years of the 20th century. The article cited for the North Carolina town, if read carefully, really only states that the tradition of having outdoor lighted trees IN THAT SPECIFIC TOWN began in 1956, not that the town claims it was the first place to have such trees. I am old enough to have been around in 1956 (though I was a small boy) and I can tell you that we and our neighbors in Southern California had lighted, outdoor trees prior to 1956, and no one thought it remarkable or unusual. The history here is questionable, to say the least."

81," Attributing and classifying of personalities Invitation. Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. Some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. My initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. We should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as iurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World wide context. A parallel example may be taken from literature of India. Poet Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. iurlionis is the best example here. In other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below We see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don't pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ram nas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism period and generation artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period, the younger generation, approx 1905 1930 painter and composer iurlionis, painter Kazys imonis, poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas Vyd nas, dramatist Sofija Kymantait iurlionien poets Adomas Jak tas, Motiejus Gustaitis, Liudas Gira, composer Stasys imkus, philosopher Ram nas Bytautas. reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them. The period between WWI and WWII and post war years. poets V Mykolaitis Putinas, Kazys Binkis, writer Ignas einius Jurk nas, artists: all 'ars' group, philosopher Juozas Girnius Modernists, introducing new Western ideas into Lithuanian cultural life Central European modernism.

I also decided to delete the account about him loosing a court case in 2000. David have launched several libel cases before in 1996 he won 45000 libel damage against an English Sunday Newspaper.
